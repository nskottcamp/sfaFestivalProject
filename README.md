# sfaFestivalProject
This is a project I completed during my 8 week Salesforce Developer Academy while at Booz Allen Hamilton. The point of the project was to practice the concepts that we were learning in class and put them into a practical application. 

The context of the project was to create a Salesforce Org that could be used to help a company which managed music festivals. A lot of the standard Salesforce setup was completed, but there is one LWC in specific I'd like to focus on, as it was the culmination of a lot of work and different concepts that we learned.
